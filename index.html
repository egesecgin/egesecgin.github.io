          I created this website with three.js to showcase my projects, each of
          my projects has summaries and a link to its detailed PDF file.

        <p>
          I decided to design my own SUMO robot for racing in regional
          competitions. I felt like I had a child when I designed the whole
          body, 3D printed it, drew the PCB layout, coded the tactics and saw it
          worked exactly the way I wanted. It was so fun to race with it and was
          a great experience for my design perspective.

        <h3 class="card-title">PCB Engraver</h3>
        <p>
          We used to produce PCBs with chemical methods for our hobby projects
          and other competitions at school, but since this way is extremely
          dangerous, time-consuming and harmful to the environment, I told my
          automation systems teacher from my school that I wanted to design a
          PCB engraver, he did really like the idea and we started to plan.
          Although it took months to calibrate and ensure stable operation, we
          started to produce a lot of PCB engravers for our school after the
          first successful prototype.

        <p>
          A monitor I designed to solve the two big problems I was facing, neck
          pain and the lack of privacy. Monitor can adjust its height itself
          automatically if I lift my chair or lower it with the help of Arduino,
          step-motor and an infrared object detection sensor. Its screen can
          only be viewed with the special glasses, people other than the user
          see the screen only as a white blank screen.

        <p>
          My team and I participated in a worldwide creativity competition
          called Destination Imagination which had lots of challenges we can
          participate in, We decided to join in the engineering challenge 2
          years in a row. Our main goal in this competition as engineering
          challengers was to combine what we designed with a story we wrote and
          play it at the same time as a team. Challenges were different each
          year, so you can find out which projects I created for the tournament and which projects I contributed to in the PDF below.

        <p>
          Me and Baran Güneysel (Senior interaction design student at ZHdK)
          decided to combine some of our ideas and offer a service, so the yoppa
          brand was formed. Our main goal was to offer our customers quality
          vegan meals, whose menu changes every day, at a very affordable price.
          At the same time, we planned to make deliveries in an environment
          friendly way and to plant a tree in a region that the customer wants
          every time a meal is ordered. We have not started operations yet, but
          our plans are ready for implementation.
